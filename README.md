# This would be your guide throug this project

## First Clone this repo

Go to your desired folder where you want this project positioned and clone this repo

````bash
  git clone https://github.com/arsen2019/faceDetection
````

## File structure 

I have main.py, face_training, and face_recognition python files. This is the order of the commands

````bash
  python main.py
  python face_training
  python face_recognition
````

After running the main.py in the command line you have to index the face WITH NUMBER. Then in the face_recognition file you have to manually write the name in the array named obviouslly names 
This project has a lot of raw parts but it's a great example of how to work with videos.

P.S The first trained user is me. You can test the project by showing the camera my image and it has to show my name. The photos of me are slightly non photogenic and anything that would be done by your side in order to make this photos more widely accesible would be confronted with a very harsh measures by my side)).
